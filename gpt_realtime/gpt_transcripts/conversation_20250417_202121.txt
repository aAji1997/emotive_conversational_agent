User: I'm a software engineer who recently moved to Seattle from Phoenix. I work at a tech startup downtown and I'm still adjusting to the rainy weather here.

Assistant: It sounds like you're going through quite a transition, Samantha! Moving from Phoenix's sunny climate to Seattle's rainy weather can be quite an adjustment. How are you finding life at the tech startup in downtown Seattle? And are you finding any new activities or places in the city that make the rain a bit more bearable?
